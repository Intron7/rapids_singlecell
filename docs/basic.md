# Welcome to the rapids-singlecell documentation

This library provides tools to accelerate single cell data analysis by running computations on the GPU. It offers analogous versions of functions found in the [scanpy](https://github.com/scverse/scanpy) library from Theis lab and the [rapids-single-cell-examples](https://github.com/clara-parabricks/rapids-single-cell-examples) library from the Nvidia RAPIDS team, with an aim to preserve compatibility with the original code. The goal of this library is to harness the power of GPU computing while maintaining the ease of use provided by scanpy.
